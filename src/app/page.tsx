In this file, we have a function component MainPage which is written in TypeScript (React.FC stands for FunctionComponent). This is the main page where the Snake game will be rendered. We use Next.js features like Image and Link. The Image component is an extension of the HTML `<img>` element, evolved for the modern web. The Link component allows for client-side navigation between two pages in the same Next.js app.

The SnakeGame component is assumed to be located in the `../components/` directory relative to this file. You would import it and then use it in the component's JSX as `<SnakeGame />`.
